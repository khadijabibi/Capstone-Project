# Capstone-Project
=====================

Project Scope
==============
This project involves developing a content management system and updating the layout for the Blue Bell website.
A requirements analysis will be carried out to determine the expected functionality of the Content Management System.
This system should be easy for the staff to use and integrate into the current website.
At a minimum, it should not require an abundant amount of database/technical knowledge, as it is an unfamiliar skill for the client.
Furthermore, the functionality of the content management system will be explained to the staff, so they can use it whenever it is required.
Furthermore, wireframes and prototypes will be produced for the updated layout of the website. 
The prototype should be done in HTML to provide an accurate representation of ideas. 
These prototypes will be tested by the client and users who are not part of the project team to determine its strengths and flaws.
